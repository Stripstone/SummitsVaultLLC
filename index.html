            <h3>Anti-Money Laundering</h3>
            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 2026</p>

            <p>SummitsVault LLC is committed to conducting business in a lawful, ethical, and transparent manner and to discouraging the use of its services for money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illicit activities.</p>

            <p><strong>Business Scope and Risk Profile</strong></p>
            <p>SummitsVault LLC primarily acquires precious metals and sells to established refineries, coin dealers, and recognized auction or trading platforms. Based on the nature and scale of its operations, the Company considers its current money laundering risk profile to be limited.</p>

            <p><strong>Risk-Based Approach</strong></p>
            <p>The Company maintains reasonable, risk-based procedures designed to identify and mitigate potential illicit activity, appropriate to the size, complexity, and stage of its business. Controls are implemented in proportion to operational risk and may evolve as the business grows.</p>

            <p><strong>Customer and Counterparty Practices</strong></p>
            <p>SummitsVault LLC generally transacts with known, reputable counterparties and maintains basic records related to acquisitions, sales, and payments. The Company does not knowingly engage in transactions involving unlawful proceeds.</p>

            <p><strong>Cash Transactions</strong></p>
            <p>The Company seeks to limit exposure to high-risk transactions, including large or anonymous cash transactions, and complies with applicable reporting and recordkeeping requirements when required by law.</p>

            <p><strong>Record Keeping</strong></p>
            <p>Transaction records, invoices, and related documentation are retained for business and compliance purposes in accordance with applicable laws and industry practices.</p>

            <p><strong>Suspicious Activity</strong></p>
            <p>If a transaction appears unusual or inconsistent with normal business activity, the Company may decline to proceed and take appropriate action consistent with applicable legal obligations.</p>

            <p><strong>Policy Review</strong></p>
            <p>This AML policy may be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect changes in business operations, regulatory requirements, or risk profile.</p>
